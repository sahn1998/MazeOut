## Project Details

<p>
This project is a ReactJS based web-application that visualizes a maze-solving algorithm.
It will allow users to set a starting point of the maze as well as an end point.
Users can also set up walls that the recursive backtracking algorithm will have to navigate around.
The recursive backtracking algorithm will start from the starting point and visualize a path it took to get to the end point.
We are using ReactJS, a front-end Javascript library to handle the front-end visualization and server-side algorithm calculations.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See package.json for dependency details.
<p>
Material UI, a React UI framework was used to import button and slider features. (https://material-ui.com/)
<p>
Button Styling was generated using a Button CSS Generator. (https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com/)

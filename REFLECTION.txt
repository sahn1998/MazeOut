What did you learn during this project?
-> During this project, we learned about the process of creating and developing a web application
while simultaneously incorporating many different programming and visualizing elements. We also
learned how to work with ReactJS, as well as the methods to output different results
based on a user’s input in a user-friendly way. In doing so, we were able to go beyond what
we have learned in class and improve our abilities to realize a better design for the program
and display diverse elements. 

What did you enjoy during this project?
-> We truly enjoyed every step of this project from brainstorming about what to build
to constructing and developing a fully functioning web application from scratch. We had times
when we faced obstacles and struggled to move forward, but once we got them sorted out, we were
proud of our accomplishments and finished product. 

What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?
-> We would say that our biggest challenge that we constantly encountered throughout the project
was working with ReactJS because we did not have much experience and knowledge with it. 
It was also challenging to figure out how to change the colors of each tile based on the 
user’s choice, as well as how to implement working algorithms to solve the maze. 

What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?
-> We found the materials we learned in class were helpful for most parts of our project.
The concept of recursive backtracking was especially useful when implementing algorithms
to solve the maze. It was also helpful to search and query many different websites and to watch
relevant tutorials as they gave us not only lessons but also inspiration to think more deeply 
and creatively. We also found it helpful to divide up the project into multiple stages and 
write code accordingly in order to move forward efficiently and fix errors step-by-step.
